            <h3>About This Project</h2>
            <p>This was a project assigned to me as a pursuit fellow. I was given a week to pick an api and make a basic website. I Chose an api around games, as playing video games is my favorite hobby. While not the best looking website I am overall proud of how the website works.</p>
            <p>The api I used (<a href="https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc">Free To Game</a>) was able to bring a vast amount of free game, around 540.</p>
